# ReduxSimpleStarter

This is a part of Udemy [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) Lesson 1 - 33, featuring a completed version of Youtube made entirely of React. 

The [boilerplate](https://github.com/helplah/ReduxSimpleStarter) contains a starting template. I'm going to do it to further and deepen my knowledge of React as part of learning through building. 

You're welcome to do so, and refer to the master branch for an example of how it should look like.
